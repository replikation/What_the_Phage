// filter needs to be addet

/*
filteroutput needs to be:

contigname,score

whereas score is from 0 to 1 (usually the tools p value)
Needs to be parsed for "categories"
e.g. a tool with phage yes / no gets 0 or 1
for multiple kategories (eg. 1 to 4 wheras 1 is phage and 4 not)
  you pares 0 0.33 0.66 1    or whatever seems reasonable for the tool
