**Fig.1**: UpSetR plot summarizes each tool's performance. Additionally, it shows which tools (black dots) identified the same contigs (black bars). 

#### **How to read this plot**  
<style>
div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}
</style>
<div class = "blue">

The total amount of identified phage contigs per tool is shown in blue bars on the left.  
Black, vertical bars visualize the number of contigs that each tool or tool combination has uniquely identified.  
Each tool combination is shown below the vertical barplot as a dot matrix. How to read the diagram: For example, 53 phage contigs are found by six tools (DeepVirFinder, Metaphinder-own-DB, Metaphinder, PPRmeta, Seeker and VirFinder).  
Another 42 contigs are found by these tools but also virnet.
