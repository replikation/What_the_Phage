**Fig.1**: UpSetR plot summarizes each tool's performance. Additionally, it shows which tools (black dots) identified the same contigs (black bars). 

#### **How to read this plot**  
<style>
div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}
</style>
<div class = "blue">

The "UpSet" plot is an alternative but more detailed Venn diagram, and it summarizes the prediction performance of each tool for your sample.  
The total amount of identified phage-contigs per tool is shown in blue bars on the left.  
Black bars visualize the number of contigs that each tool or tool combination has uniquely identified, and each tool combination is shown below each black bar as a dot matrix. 
E.g., a black bar with two dots below it means that these two tools identified the same contigs as phages.
